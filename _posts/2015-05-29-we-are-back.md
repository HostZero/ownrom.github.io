We are back

Starting this saturday we will have the first ROM builds come out in a long while. These builds will be based off of the latest version of Android [5.1.1] and Cyanogenmod 12.1. While these builds will be fairly feature light at first, more features are will be added in as time goes on.

The following devices should have builds by Saturday though one or two may not:

* Android One [Sprout]

* Samsung Galaxy S3 [I9300]

* Nexus 6 [Shamu]

* Moto X [Ghost]

* Sony Xperia SP [Huashan]

* Samsung Galaxy S4 [Jflte]

* Moto G  2013 [Falcon]

* Samsung Galaxy S4 [I9505]

Some of you may also want to know why we havent had any builds in a while. This is because some of us had exams and other personal maters that we had to attend to resulting in the builds being delayed to the summer which is now.

Anyway we should have the first builds coming out tomorrow so get ready to flash!
