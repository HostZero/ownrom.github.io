title: We Will Be Back
---

To all users,

**DO NOT WORRY** 

This isn't good bye, this is a short vacation untill N hits the sources...

There is to much code to do by my self, and i have a beautifull son of nearly 12 weeks old, and he grows to fast...

These are the main reasons I want to have a vacation, so do not be dissapointed, we will be back soon...

I will still be active to help when someone needs me, but Marshmallow will no longer be supported for all devices...

**WE WILL BS BACK WITH ANDROID N!**
